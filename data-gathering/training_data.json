He sprinted to the vault door, the heavy steel looming ominously in front of him. The sound of Annie's voice echoed in the background, urging him to reconsider their violent path, but the promise of gold was too tantalizing to ignore.

As he hastily rifled through the kit, he could hear Clara Mae rallying her posse outside, preparing to storm the bank. With mere moments to act, Dakota faced a critical choice: should he try to use the locksmith's tools to open the vault quickly and risk getting caught, or should he abandon the heist altogether and make a dash for the back exit, leaving the gold behind? The tension was palpable, and the decision weighed heavily on his shoulders. [Key phrase: ]",
