**AI-Based Multiplayer RPG Game - Requirements Document**

# **Table of Contents**
1. **Introduction**
   - __Purpose of the Document__
        - The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the AI-zbased Multiplayer RPG Game. It serves as a reference for the developers when testing and designing the game.By outlining the functional, and nonfunctional,business and user requirements, this document aims to establish a structred approach to development while maintaining clarity and consistency. 

        - This document provides detailed specifications regarding User interactions, system behavior, and AI-driven mechanics. It ensures that the game's core elements, such as dynamic storytelling, role-based gameplay, and Ai generated conent are well-defined and verifiable. Additionally, this document aims to follow industry best practices by using the MoSCoW method. 

        - By referencing this document the develpment team will be able to effectivley build a robust and immersive multiplayer experience, where AI dynamically adapts to the game play creating a unique and engaging experience for players. the document will also serve as a foundation for the project evaluation, testing and future expansion of the game. 


   - __Scope of the Project__
        - The AI-Based Multiplayer RPG Game is designed as a real-time, AI-driven, multiplayer role-playing game that allows players to engage in dynamic, procedurally generated adventures. The game will be hosted on a central server, with players joining through a web-based client. The AI will act as both a game master and an adaptive element that personalizes gameplay based on player decisions.
        -  Key aspects of the project’s scope include:

            - __Multiplayer Integration__: Players can join the game via web-based connections, interacting with AI-generated scenarios and other players in a shared world.

            - __AI-Driven Gameplay__: AI will dynamically generate quests, characters, and world-building elements, ensuring a unique experience each session.

            - __Genre Customization__: Players can select from multiple game genres (Fantasy, Cyberpunk, Horror, etc.), affecting the story, setting, and mechanics.

            - __Character Development__: Players can create, customize, and develop their characters with ability trees, leveling systems, and inventory management.

            - __Game Master & Watcher Roles__: Some players may take on facilitator roles, allowing them to shape the game’s events or interact indirectly with active participants.

            - __Surprise Elements__: AI-driven randomness will introduce unpredictable twists, moral dilemmas, and unique decision-making paths.

            - __Cross-Device Accessibility__: The game will be playable from desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones through a browser-based interface.

            - __User Progress & Persistence__: Players will have the option to save their character progress and resume gameplay in future sessions.

        - __Out of Scope:__

            - VR or AR features (considered for future versions)

            - Console support (the game will be browser-based)

            - Fully scripted campaigns (the game relies on AI-driven dynamic storytelling rather than pre-written quests)

            - Blockchain-based rewards or in-game purchases

            - The scope of this project ensures a scalable, engaging, and AI-enhanced role-playing experience while remaining achievable within the given development timeframe. Future updates may expand the project’s capabilities, but the initial version will focus on delivering a high-quality, replayable, AI-driven multiplayer game.
