## Business Requirements
The following requirements will be used to increase revenue and overall player count.



### Analytics
The program will store information about users and how they engage with the platform. The following information will be tracked and sent to a separate business server for analyzing the data.

  * ***User Engagement:*** The program will keep track of users' time spent in activities such as single-player experiences, multiplayer, and co-op experiences within the game.

  * ***User Spending:*** The program will keep track of the user's monetary transactions within the game. It will store when, how much, and what the user spent money on. 

  * ***User Information:*** The program will keep track of user demographic info such as location, age, and hardware.

  * ***Player Count:*** The program will keep track of the number of active players per day.


### User Acquisition Strategy:
A variety of strategies will be executed to increase user acquisition. 

* ***Search Engine Optimization (SEO):*** Optimize the gameâ€™s website and app store listings with targeted keywords to rank higher in search results.

* ***"Next-level Marketing Strategy:"*** Users will be able to pay a monthly fee to become a game distributor. For every person they get to buy the game, they will receive 10% of the game sale. They can sign up others to be game distributors under them for which they will receive 5% of any game sales their game distributors sell. Game distributors will also get a special in-game icon to represent themselves. (Definitely Won't have)
  

#### Community Building
As part of our user acquisition strategy, we will deploy a variety of features in order to foster a strong community for the game which will in return attract more players.

*  ***Social Media Campaigns:*** Regularly update social media channels (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok) with content like sneak peeks, gameplay trailers, updates, and community engagement. Social media will be linked on the official game site.

  
### User Retention Strategy

### Business Requirements MoSCoW Analysis:
For version 1.0 of our project, we will largely focus on the main core single-player experience, so much of our business requirements will not be prioritized until the base gameplay of our game is finished.

#### Must-Have:

* Progression feature

* Paid Model

#### Should-Have:

* Multiplayer




#### Could-Have:
* Leaderboards: Leaderboards could be implemented, but are likely more suitable after core gameplay features and mechanics are implemented. The game should be fun to play before trying to build a competitive scene.
  
* Analytics: We could implement a way to track user information for analytic purposes as that would be helpful for the business owner to make decisions, but we don't expect this will be in version 1.0. We want the game to be playable before we worry about collecting data for business decisions.

#### Won't Have:

* Name change monetization: We won't be implementing name change monetization because we already have more important monetization strategies and don't want over monetize the game such that users view it as a money grab.

* "Next-level Marketing": This is indeed an idea, but probably a terrible idea that would ruin the reputation of the game, but it is always an option in the future if the customer gets desperate.

* "Character Boost Monetization": Like name change monetization we already have some standard monetization options and don't want to over-monetize the game.



Note: Chat-GPT was used to generate some of the ideas for business requirements. It also wrote a few requirements such as SEO requirements, Social media Campaigns, and most of the user retention strategy.
