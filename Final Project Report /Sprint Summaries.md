## Formal Meetings

### January 13th (3:00 PM) – All Members Attended
- Notes for this meeting were limited, as it was more of a "get to know you" meeting.  
- Game ideas were discussed, with some people suggesting RPGs, card games, choose-your-own-adventures, and roguelikes.  
- The medium was discussed with some proposing vector graphics, but that was quickly decided against.  
- Then it was debated between 2D graphics and text-based. The decision was tabled until more requirements came forward in class.

### January 13th (After Class) – Informal Meeting, All Members Attended
- Discussed project requirements and each member agreed to come up with some requirement questions for the next class.

### January 17th (After Class) – Informal Meeting, All Members Attended
- Discussed requirement doc and that a formal meeting would be needed.

### January 21st (1:15–2:15) – All Members Attended
- The team discussed the progress of a requirements document, potential ideas for a project, and the possibility of merging an RPG and a card game into one.  
- They also considered the implementation of a card game and a roguelike game, focusing on AI-generated cards and the player's ability to build a unique deck.  
- The team discussed the division of tasks for a project, potential monetization strategies, and the roles and responsibilities for the upcoming project.
- The following were tasks assigned in the last 15 minutes to ensure completion of the assignment
- **Sam** to work on user requirements and user stories  
- **Justin** to work on functional requirements  
- **Carson** to work on non-functional requirements  
- **Jaden** to work on business requirements

- Team to review MoSCoW requirements together before submission  
- All team members to communicate if they need help with their assigned tasks  

## Number of Hours Spent by Each Team Member per Task

> There were few tasks for this sprint with only the requirements document being required. I was unaware of tracking hours until partway through the sprint, but I had each member estimate their hours on their portion of the requirements doc and other miscellaneous tasks.

- **Jaden:** 8 Hours  
- **Sam:** 3 Hours  
- **Carson:** 3.5 Hours  
- **Kade:** 3.5 Hours  
- **Justin:** 3 Hours
- **Andy:** 3 Hours  

## Tasks Worked On in the Sprint

### Who Accepted Each Task?
- **Sam:** User requirements  
- **Kade:** Diagrams

- **Carson:** Non-functional requirements  
- **Jaden:** Business requirements  
- **Andy:** Markdown, merging, and proofreading  

> Note that these tasks do not account for all hours, as in the group chat we each would volunteer to do little things throughout the sprint.

### Which Tasks Were Completed?
- All tasks were completed.

## Personal Reflection

I was super worried when we met as a group at first because they all were terrifying me with their excitement. It sounds bad, but they were just so excited to make a video game that they were going crazy with these super complex ideas that I swear wouldn't get done in a year, much less a semester. Meanwhile, I had literally just dropped game development because it sounds terrible to me. I also didn't want my group to think I was in for an easy buck (I need to pass this time around), but I also am swamped with work (like, I can handle the normal course load, but if we're each coding like 30 hours a week, I'mma drown).

So I was like, "Oh no, we're gonna bite off way more than we can chew." But as the ideas came around and the requirements became more clear, I was actually getting excited, and I think our concept is really cool and actually achievable. I think that we're all pretty excited, and it's evident in our requirements doc because we got ahead of ourselves and a bit of high-level design slipped into the requirements. But there has to be a database, and I think I get to do it, which will be so fun.

## Meetings

### Date: 02/26/25
#### Minutes
This meeting was held during a workday in class. As a team, we put together tasks in GitHub issues. These tasks were assigned
to the respective team (backend, frontend, AI), and we assigned story points. This meeting helped us work out frontend/backend integrations,
as we really focused on API endpoints and how we are going to pass data to/from the backend. 

### Attendees:
- Kade
- Samuel
- Jaden
- Justin
- Andy

### Topics Covered:
1. JSON data format
2. Necessary API endpoints
3. Frontend hooks to update ui
4. Frontend type definitions

## Rejected Tasks (If Any):
- OAuth 


### Explanation for Rejection:
#### OAuth
We decided that this was too much hassle at this point. Sometime in the future we may add this,
but for now the team decided it was unnecessary and not worth the work involved


---

## Disposition of Incomplete Tasks:

#### Image Generation
For now, image generation is a should have. After Justin and Samuel did some research, we decided it will
cost us money and considerable effort. This is still a feature we would love to implement, but we are going to work 
on getting core functionality in place first.

#### OAuth
Oauth was cancelled as unnecessary. We are just going to encrypt passwords with SHA256 encryption,
which will be plenty enough for our simple game.
