## Architecture
The system will follow a Client-Server Architecture with distinct components: the Client, the Backend Server, and external services for AI generation, card generation (images), and authentication.

* ***Client:*** The user interface that will allow players to interact with the game (e.g., through a text interface or console).
* ***Backend Server:*** The heart of the application, responsible for maintaining game state, user management, card handling, story generation, and business logic.
* ***External Services:***
  * ***AI Story Generator:*** An AI system (such as a fine-tuned LLM) generates the dynamic story.
  * ***Card Image Generator:*** An AI-based image generation API to create unique card images.
  * ***Authentication Service:*** A third-party service for user account management (OAuth, Firebase, etc.).

#### Design Rationale:
This modular setup allows each component to be developed and scaled independently. By using a client-server architecture, we ensure that the backend logic is centralized, which makes it easier to maintain and update the game. External services are isolated so that any changes in their implementation do not affect the core game logic.
