# Security Design
This document was generated with the assistance of ChatGPT, which provided efficient and well-structured explanations for our chosen security measures. It helped articulate our reasoning more clearly and concisely than I could have expressed on my own, ensuring a thorough and well-documented approach to our security design.

## Authentication and Authorization
To secure user accounts and prevent unauthorized access, I chose **OAuth** for authentication. This is an industry-standard approach that removes the need for our game to store and manage passwords directly, reducing security risks.

- **OAuth Implementation:** Players will log in using trusted third-party authentication providers like Google, Microsoft, or Apple. This makes it easier for players to sign in without having to remember new credentials while also leveraging the security measures that these platforms already have in place.
- **Token-Based Authentication:** After a successful login, a short-lived access token will be issued, while a refresh token could be used to maintain session continuity. I chose this approach because it balances security and user convenience. This would keep users logged in without forcing them to re-login multiple times.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** This will be an optional feature for users who want to add security, particularly for accounts with high in-game value. I included this because it mitigates account takeovers but won't be mandatory unless we store sensitive personal data like credit cards.

## Data Protection & Privacy
Protecting player data is a top priority. I designed our approach based on encryption best practices and compliance with industry regulations.

- **Encryption of Sensitive Data:** Any personally identifiable information (PII) or game-related data will be encrypted where necessary. I chose this because it minimizes risks in case of data leaks while ensuring compliance with security standards.
- **Anonymized Analytics:** Analytics data will be aggregated and anonymized before storage to comply with regulations like GDPR and CCPA. This ensures that player data remains private while still allowing us to analyze game trends.
- **Secure Communication:** I chose TLS 1.3 encryption for client-server communication because it prevents eavesdropping and MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks. TLS 1.3 is also faster than previous versions because it only requires one round trip instead of two. This is especially useful for multiplayer gaming, where latency matters.

## Payment Security with Stripe
Since we could be handling in-game transactions, I decided to use Stripe as our payment processor.

- Stripe is a widely trusted payment provider with built-in security measures like PCI DSS compliance and fraud detection. It also supports multiple payment methods, including credit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay, making it easy for players to complete transactions securely.
- Instead of handling credit card details directly, we will use Stripe’s tokenization system to process payments securely. This means we never store sensitive payment data ourselves, reducing our security liability.
- Stripe includes real-time fraud detection, which helps prevent unauthorized transactions. I chose this because it adds an extra layer of security to in-game purchases and prevents chargebacks due to fraudulent activity.

## Mitigating Common Attacks
Since online games are often targeted by cyber threats, I designed a set of security measures to protect our game from common attacks.

### 1. DDoS Protection
DDoS attacks can cause major disruptions in multiplayer games, so I implemented multiple layers of defense:

- **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Limits excessive requests from a single source to prevent bot-driven traffic spikes.
- **Traffic Monitoring & IP Filtering:** Detects unusual traffic patterns and blocks suspicious requests before they affect gameplay.
- **CDN & Load Balancing:** A Content Delivery Network (CDN) distributes game assets efficiently, and load balancing ensures fair distribution of incoming traffic across servers.

### 2. SQL Injection & Input Validation
Malicious actors may attempt to manipulate game database queries via SQL injection. Preventative measures include:

- **Parameterized Queries & ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):** Using Django ORM or SQL ensures all user inputs are automatically sanitized before being used in queries.
- **Strict Input Validation:** We ensure that all user input (usernames, chat messages, deck names) is validated before being processed, reducing the risk of malicious data being injected.

### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
To prevent unauthorized script execution and malicious actions via the web interface:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Restricts execution of inline scripts and untrusted external sources. This prevents attackers from injecting harmful scripts into the game.
- **CSRF Tokens:** Every authenticated request requiring user action will include **unique CSRF tokens** to prevent unauthorized actions from malicious websites. This ensures that only requests originating from authorized users are accepted.

### 4. Account Takeovers & Brute Force Attacks
To prevent attackers from guessing login credentials:

- **Account Lockouts & CAPTCHA:** After a certain number of failed login attempts, the system will **lock the account temporarily** and require a CAPTCHA verification. This makes it more difficult for attackers to use automated scripts to guess passwords.
- **IP Monitoring:** Repeated failed login attempts from a single IP will trigger **temporary bans** to deter brute-force attacks. This helps prevent attackers from systematically guessing login credentials.

### 5. Prompt Injection Protection
Given the integration of AI-driven features, prompt injection attacks pose a potential threat where malicious inputs could manipulate AI responses:

- **Input Sanitization:** All user inputs interacting with AI components will undergo strict sanitization to remove harmful code or hidden instructions.
- **Context Isolation:** The AI’s processing context will be isolated, ensuring that user-generated content cannot alter system-level instructions or modify AI behavior unexpectedly.
- **Output Validation:** AI-generated outputs will be validated to detect and block any unauthorized commands or sensitive data disclosures before reaching the user interface.

## Secure Multiplayer & Fair Play
Since the game features **multiplayer components**, additional security measures are needed to **prevent cheating, exploits, and unauthorized modifications.**

- **Server-Side Game Logic Validation:** All crucial game logic (e.g., deck-building, in-game purchases) will be validated **on the server**, preventing client-side tampering. This ensures that users cannot manipulate game data on their own devices.
- **Cheat Detection Algorithms:** Player behavior will be **analyzed for anomalies**, such as **impossible win rates, artificially inflated resources, or modified game files.** This allows us to detect and prevent cheating.
- **Secure WebSocket Connections:** Multiplayer communication will use **secure WebSocket connections** with end-to-end encryption to prevent interception. This ensures that player interactions remain private and tamper-proof.

## Disaster Recovery & Incident Response
A well-defined **disaster recovery plan** ensures security incidents are handled effectively:

- **Automated Backups:** Game data will be backed up **daily** with encrypted storage. This ensures that data can be restored in the event of a failure.
- **Incident Detection & Alerts:** Security incidents will trigger **real-time alerts**, allowing administrators to respond quickly. This ensures that any security threats are addressed as soon as they arise.
- **Post-Incident Audits:** All security events will be **logged** and **audited** to improve future security measures. This helps refine security strategies and prevent similar issues in the future.

## Conclusion
The security strategy outlined above ensures **robust protection against cyber threats** while maintaining a seamless user experience. By incorporating **OAuth authentication, encryption, DDoS protection, anti-cheat measures, and prompt injection defenses,** the game will be resilient to attacks, safeguarding both user data and gameplay integrity.
