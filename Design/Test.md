# Our Testing Plan

In this document, we outline our approach and strategy for thoroughly testing our application. Our goal is to ensure that every critical aspect of the system works as expected, providing a reliable and bug-free experience for our users.

## Testing Approach and Philosophy

### Unit Testing & Code Coverage
- **Objective:** Verify core business logic, API endpoints, and UI components.
- **Plan:** Write unit tests focusing on the most essential functionalities.
- **Target:** Aim for approximately 85% code coverage on both the frontend and backend to ensure we cover all critical features.

### Integration and System-Level Testing
- **Objective:** Confirm that different modules interact seamlessly.
- **Plan:** Implement integration tests that validate the communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Additional Testing:** Conduct end-to-end simulations to replicate real user scenarios, ensuring the application behaves as intended.

### Extended Testing Areas
- **Database Testing:**
  - **Objective:** Ensure our database schema enforces primary keys and maintains data integrity.
  - **Plan:** Run tests that simulate scenarios such as duplicate key insertions, schema migrations, and complex queries to verify referential integrity.
  
- **S3 Testing for Primary Keys and Image URLs:**
  - **Objective:** Validate that images uploaded to S3 have correctly generated primary keys and that the image URLs are both accurate and accessible.
  - **Plan:** Simulate image uploads and test the resulting data for consistency.

## System-Level Testing for the Final Presentation

### 1. End-to-End User Scenarios
- **Setup:** Launch both the backend and frontend services locally.
- **Actions:** Simulate typical game scenarios such as user logins, game state transitions, score updates, and multiplayer interactions.
- **Expected Outcome:** The UI and backend database should consistently reflect the correct state without any error messages.

### 2. Stress Testing
- **Setup:** Use a controlled environment to mimic multiple users interacting simultaneously.
- **Actions:** Monitor the application's behavior under high load, especially during real-time game updates.
- **Expected Outcome:** The system should remain stable, with any performance degradation falling within acceptable limits.

### 3. Ad-Hoc Manual Tests
- **Steps:**
  - Launch the application on various devices and browsers.
  - Interact with key features (e.g., multiplayer lobby, gameplay, scoreboards).
  - Record outcomes using screenshots and log files.
- **Expected Outcome:** Ensure consistent UI rendering and correct business logic execution across all scenarios.

### 4. Database and S3 Integration Tests
- **Database Testing:**
  - **Setup:** Use test databases pre-seeded with data that reflect real-world conditions.
  - **Actions:** Perform insert, update, and delete operations, verifying that primary keys and relationships are maintained.
  - **Expected Outcome:** No duplicate keys or broken relationships; migrations should execute without errors.
  
- **S3 Testing:**
  - **Setup:** Configure the application to use a test S3 bucket.
  - **Actions:** Simulate image uploads and confirm that each upload generates a correct primary key and a valid image URL.
  - **Expected Outcome:** Each image URL should correctly point to an accessible image on S3, and any errors in the upload process must be gracefully handled.

## Steps to Reproduce Test Results

### 1. Set Up the Environment
- **Clone Repositories:** Clone both the backend and frontend repositories.
- **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` (or the equivalent command) in each directory.
- **Configuration:** Set up test databases and configure the test S3 bucket according to our documentation.

### 2. Run Unit and Integration Tests
- **Backend:** Execute the test suite using `npm test` (or your preferred command) in the backend directory.
- **Frontend:** Run the tests in the frontend directory similarly.
- **Review:** Check the code coverage reports (e.g., via Istanbul or Jest) to ensure we meet our coverage targets.

### 3. Perform System-Level Tests
- **Launch Services:** Start the backend server and the frontend application.
- **User Flow Simulation:** Follow a typical user flow â€“ log in, initiate a game, simulate multiple user actions, and observe the behavior.
- **Capture Evidence:** Take screenshots at key steps:
  - **Screenshot 1:** Code coverage summary (approximately 85% for the backend and around 75% for the frontend).
  - **Screenshot 2:** The main game screen during a live session.
  - **Screenshot 3:** Logs from a stress test run, highlighting the successful handling of concurrent operations.
  - **Screenshot 4:** Test results confirming database integrity and accurate S3 image URL generation.

### 4. Document Outcomes
- **Verification:** Confirm that all tests pass with the expected outcomes.
- **Observation:** Note any anomalies in the logs or UI.
- **Iteration:** Use these findings to further refine and improve the application.
