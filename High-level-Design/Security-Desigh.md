# Security Design

## Authentication and Authorization
To secure user accounts and prevent unauthorized access, the game will implement **OAuth 2.0** for authentication. This approach offers a secure, industry-standard way to manage login credentials while ensuring user data protection. Key aspects of authentication include:

- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Users will log in via trusted third-party authentication providers (e.g., Google, Discord, Steam).
- **Token-Based Authentication:** After successful login, a short-lived **access token** will be issued, while a refresh token can be used to maintain session continuity.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** For additional security, users may enable **2FA** via email or authentication apps.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Specific administrative functions (e.g., moderating multiplayer sessions, handling reports) will require **elevated privileges**, ensuring only authorized personnel can access critical game functions.

## Data Protection & Privacy
User privacy and secure data handling are a priority. The game will adhere to industry best practices for **encryption, storage, and compliance** with data protection regulations.

- **Password Protection:** User passwords will be **hashed and salted** using a strong hashing algorithm (**Argon2, bcrypt, or PBKDF2**).
- **Encryption of Sensitive Data:** All personally identifiable information (**PII**) and game-related data stored in the database will be **AES-256 encrypted**.
- **Anonymized Analytics:** User analytics data will be **aggregated and anonymized** before being stored for business analysis, ensuring compliance with **GDPR and CCPA**.
- **Secure Communication:** All client-server interactions will use **TLS 1.3 encryption** to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Mitigating Common Attacks
The game must be resilient against various forms of cyber threats that can disrupt gameplay or compromise user data.

### 1. DDoS Protection
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can overload game servers, causing latency issues or service disruptions. To mitigate this:

- **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** API requests and multiplayer actions will be **rate-limited** to prevent excessive requests from a single source.
- **Traffic Monitoring & IP Filtering:** Traffic will be monitored using **behavioral analysis and anomaly detection** to identify and block suspicious activity.
- **CDN & Load Balancing:** A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** will distribute game data efficiently, while **load balancing** ensures traffic is handled evenly across multiple servers.
- **Cloudflare or AWS Shield Integration:** A cloud-based **DDoS mitigation service** will be used to filter out malicious traffic before it reaches game servers.

### 2. SQL Injection & Input Validation
Malicious actors may attempt to manipulate game database queries via SQL injection. Preventative measures include:

- **Parameterized Queries & ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):** Instead of raw SQL, an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Django ORM) will be used to sanitize user input.
- **Strict Input Validation:** All user inputs (e.g., usernames, chat messages, deck names) will be **validated and sanitized** before processing.

### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
To prevent unauthorized script execution and malicious actions via the web interface:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Restricts execution of inline scripts and untrusted external sources.
- **CSRF Tokens:** Every authenticated request requiring user action will include **unique CSRF tokens** to prevent unauthorized actions from malicious websites.

### 4. Account Takeovers & Brute Force Attacks
To prevent attackers from guessing login credentials:

- **Account Lockouts & CAPTCHA:** After a certain number of failed login attempts, the system will **lock the account temporarily** and require a CAPTCHA verification.
- **IP Monitoring:** Repeated failed login attempts from a single IP will trigger **temporary bans** to deter brute-force attacks.

## Secure Multiplayer & Fair Play
Since the game features **multiplayer components**, additional security measures are needed to **prevent cheating, exploits, and unauthorized modifications.**

- **Server-Side Game Logic Validation:** All crucial game logic (e.g., deck-building, in-game purchases) will be validated **on the server**, preventing client-side tampering.
- **Cheat Detection Algorithms:** Player behavior will be **analyzed for anomalies**, such as **impossible win rates, artificially inflated resources, or modified game files.**
- **Secure WebSocket Connections:** Multiplayer communication will use **secure WebSocket connections** with end-to-end encryption to prevent interception.

## Disaster Recovery & Incident Response
A well-defined **disaster recovery plan** ensures security incidents are handled effectively:

- **Automated Backups:** Game data will be backed up **daily** with encrypted storage.
- **Incident Detection & Alerts:** Security incidents will trigger **real-time alerts**, allowing administrators to respond quickly.
- **Post-Incident Audits:** All security events will be **logged** and **audited** to improve future security measures.

## Conclusion
The security strategy outlined above ensures **robust protection against cyber threats** while maintaining a seamless user experience. By incorporating **OAuth authentication, encryption, DDoS protection, and anti-cheat measures,** the game will be resilient to attacks, safeguarding both user data and gameplay integrity.
